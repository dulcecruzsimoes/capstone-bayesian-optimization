# Bayesian Optimization for Black Box Functions

## Overview

This repository contains the approach and results of a Bayesian Optimization competition. The goal was to maximize several black-box functions using Bayesian Optimization. The dataset consists of a series of functions with various input dimensions and corresponding outputs. The final position achieved in this competition was 24th place.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the initial input and output data for each function.
- `main_optimization.py`: The main script for loading data, running Bayesian Optimization, and predicting the next query points.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Code Explanation

### Loading and Preparing Data

The data consists of multiple functions (f1 to f8) with varying input dimensions. Each function has initial input data and corresponding outputs. New data from CSV files are loaded and concatenated with the initial data to form the complete dataset for each function. The inputs are converted from string representation to numpy arrays, ensuring they are in the correct range (0.000001 to 0.999999).

### Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian Optimization is used to predict the next query points for each function. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is utilized to model the functions, and hyperparameters of the GPR are optimized using the `gp_minimize` function from the `skopt` library. Different kernels (RBF, Matern, and RBF + WhiteKernel) are tested to determine the best kernel for each function.

### K-Fold Validation

To ensure robust evaluation, K-Fold validation is used to evaluate the model performance. This approach splits the data into multiple folds, trains the model on some folds, and tests it on the remaining folds. The performance is averaged across all folds to provide a robust estimate of the model's accuracy.

### Optimization Process

For each function, the Bayesian Optimization process involves the following steps:
1. **Define the Search Space**: The search space for hyperparameters includes constants, length scales, and kernel types.
2. **Objective Function**: The objective function, which the optimization algorithm seeks to maximize, is evaluated using K-Fold validation.
3. **Run Optimization**: The `gp_minimize` function is used to perform Bayesian Optimization, identifying the best hyperparameters and predicting the next query points.
4. **Predict Next Query Points**: Using the best-found model, the next query points for each function are predicted.

### Final Results

After running the Bayesian Optimization process, the model predicted the next query points for each function.

## Analysis and Future Work

There are several approaches and improvements that could be made to achieve better performance:
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: This technique involves exploring a broader set of hyperparameter values to find the combination that offers the best model performance. Automated tools like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV can be used for this purpose, but a more manual and refined process may be necessary for final optimization.

2. **Advanced Kernels**: Different kernels can capture various characteristics of the data. The use of composite or more complex kernels, such as combining RBF with periodic kernels, can help model complex patterns in the target functions.

3. **Ensemble Methods**: Utilizing a combination of several models (ensemble) can increase robustness and accuracy. Models like Random Forest, Boosting, and Bagging can be used in conjunction with Gaussian Processes to improve predictions.

4. **Active Learning**: This approach involves actively selecting the most informative data points to query, instead of selecting randomly. This is particularly useful in optimization scenarios where each evaluation is expensive or time-consuming.

5. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing features can help models capture patterns in the data better. Techniques like PCA, polynomial features, or logarithmic transformations can be explored.

6. **Dividing the Function Space**: In some complex functions, it may be advantageous to divide the input space into regions and apply different models or approaches in each region. This is known as regional modeling and can significantly improve accuracy if different parts of the input space exhibit different behaviors.


By implementing these strategies, the performance of the Bayesian Optimization model could be significantly improved in future competitions.
